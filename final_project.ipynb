Itâ€™s a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use as common packages have been  pre-installed. Google users can have access to a Tesla T4 GPU (approximately 15G memory). Note that when you connect to a GPU-based VM runtime, you are given a maximum of 12 hours at a time on the VM.\n",

    "In this project, you will undertake an NLP task in _sentiment analysis_. We will begin by guiding you through data understanding, pre-processing, and instructing you to construct RNN and CNN models for the task. Afterward, you are encouraged to develop your own model to improve the results. The final test set will be released on **11 December 2024 at 5pm** (48 hours before the final project deadline). You will use your own system to generate the outputs. The system with the highest F1 score will be announced as the winner for each challenge. If no clear winner emerges from the test set results, further analysis or evaluations may be conducted."

    "## Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "With the proliferation of online social media and review platforms, vast amounts of opinionated data have been generated, offering immense potential to support decision-making processes. Sentiment analysis examines people's sentiments expressed in text, such as product reviews, blog comments, and forum discussions. It finds wide applications in diverse fields, including politics (e.g., analyzing public sentiment towards policies), finance (e.g., evaluating market sentiments), and marketing (e.g., product research and brand management).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since sentiments can often be categorized into discrete polarities or scales (e.g., positive or negative), sentiment analysis can be framed as a text classification task. This task involves transforming text sequences of varying lengths into fixed-length categorical labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data pre-processing\n",
    "In this project, we will utilize [Stanford's large movie review dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/%7Eamaas/data/sentiment/) for sentiment analysis. The dataset consists of a training set and a testing set, each containing 25,000 movie reviews sourced from IMDb. Both datasets have an equal number of \"positive\" and \"negative\" labels, representing different sentiment polarities. Please download and extract this IMDb review dataset in the path `../data/aclImdb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hints*: While the following instructions are based on a split of 25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing, you are free to choose your own dataset split, as we will provide a separate test set for the final evaluation. However, any changes you make to the default split must be clearly indicated in your report. Failure to explicitly mention such modifications may result in a penalty.\n",
